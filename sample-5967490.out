This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 124 of the file /projects/mast4878/LouCode/7PS_pre_Shift/parallelSimuMeta.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="lxml"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.
